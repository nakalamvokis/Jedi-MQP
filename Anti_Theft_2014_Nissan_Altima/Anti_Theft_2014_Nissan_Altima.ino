  * Authors: Nicholas Kalamvokis, Santiago Rojas, Brian St. Germain, Mark Bentson
  *
  * Brief: This program serves as an Anti_Theft, Anti-Tampering system. It detects when UDS
  *        packets are being transferred by a malicious device on the CAN Network and signals
  *        to the user that the vehicle is at risk. There is also detection for doors and locks
  *        changing state as well as other peripherals changing state.
  *
  * Notes:
  *        - The "CAN_BUS_Shield-master" library must be added to your Arduino IDE for this
  *          program to compile successfully.
  *        - This program is written for the SEEED CAN Bus Shield.
  *        - This code has been written to protect a 2014 Nissan Altima.
